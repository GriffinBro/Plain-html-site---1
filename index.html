    <h2 class="header-2">Introduction to Neuroscience</h2>
    <p class="para">Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, including its structure, function,
        development, and
        disorders. It's a multidisciplinary field that combines anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, and
        developmental biology.</p><br>

    <h4 class="header-4">Neuroscientists study how the nervous system works, including:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>How brain cells signal and connect to each other</li>
        <li>How the brain evolved</li>
        <li>How cells differentiate into different types of brain cells</li>
        <li>What happens in the brain when we have emotions, thoughts, create art, music, read, and write</li>
        <li>How babies learn language and read</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="para">Neuroscientists also study diseases, disorders, and injuries that affect the nervous system.
        Neuroscience is an
        interdisciplinary career path that works closely with other fields like psychology, linguistics, engineering,
        computers, mathematics, and medicine.</p><br><br>

    <h2 class="header-2">Neuroplasticity</h2><br>
    <img id="Neuroplasticity-img" src="images/Neuroplasticity.png" alt="Neuroplasticity" title="Neuroplasticity">
    <p class="para">Neuroplasticity is defined as the ability of the nervous system to change its activity in response
        to intrinsic or extrinsic
        stimuli by reorganizing its structure, functions, or connections after injuries, such as a stroke or traumatic
        brain injury (TBI).</p><br>

    <h4 class="header-4">Neuroplasticity can involve:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Structural changes: The brain's structure can change, including the formation and elimination of synapses.
        </li>
        <li>Functional changes: The brain's functions can change, such as the strength of synaptic connections.</li>
        <li>Reorganization: The brain can reorganize itself to create new neural connections.</li>
        <li>Neuroplasticity can be beneficial, neutral, or negative. For example, it can help restore function after an
            injury, like a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, it can also have negative consequences.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="header-4">Factors that can influence neuroplasticity include:</h4>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Exercise</li>
        <li>Stress</li>
        <li>Differentiated stimulation</li>
        <li>Attention</li>
        <li>Sustained engagement</li>
        <li>Effortful processing</li>
        <li>Novelty and complexity</li>
    </ol><br><br>

    <h2 class="header-2">Mental Health</h2>
    <p class="para">Mental health encompasses emotional, psychological, and social well-being, influencing cognition,
        perception, and behavior. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is a "state of well-being in
        which the individual realizes his or her abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work
        productively and fruitfully, and can contribute to his or her community". It likewise determines how an
        individual handles stress, interpersonal relationships, and decision-making. Mental health includes
        subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, intergenerational dependence, and
        self-actualization of one's intellectual and emotional potential, among others.</p><br><br>

    <h2 class="header-2">Key Brain Functions</h2>
    <h4 class="header-4">The brain has many key functions, including:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Movement: The brain controls all voluntary actions of the body, including simple tasks like picking up an
            object. </li>
        <li>Breathing: The brainstem controls the basic rhythm of breathing by sending nerve impulses to the diaphragm
            and other breathing muscles.</li>
        <li> Heart rate: The brain controls the heart's function by sending commands through nerves to adjust the heart
            rate and how hard it works. </li>
        <li> Body temperature: The hypothalamus in the brain plays a key role in regulating body temperature. </li>
        <li>Working memory: A cognitive system with limited capacity that's important for reasoning, decision-making,
            and planning.</li>
        <li>Cognitive flexibility: The ability to respond to the world in a dynamic and adaptive way.</li>
        <li>Inhibitory control: An executive function that limits unnecessary thoughts and actions.</li>
    </ul><br><br>

    <h2 class="header-2">Conclusion</h2><br>
    <p class="para">The brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord, comprises the
        central nervous system. It consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum. The brain controls most
        of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and coordinating the information it receives from the
        sensory nervous system. The brain integrates the instructions sent to the rest of the body. The brain is
        contained in, and protected by, the skull of the head.</p><br><br>
