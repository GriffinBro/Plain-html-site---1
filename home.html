    <p>Mental health encompasses emotional, psychological, and social well-being, influencing cognition, perception, and
        behavior. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is a "state of well-being in which the individual
        realizes his or her abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully,
        and can contribute to his or her community". It likewise determines how an individual handles stress,
        interpersonal relationships, and decision-making. Mental health includes subjective well-being, perceived
        self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, intergenerational dependence, and self-actualization of one's intellectual
        and emotional potential, among others.</p>
